Consider that you are a software engineer at a digital advertising agency Zox. Zox manages social media account for their clients. Zox clients often need their latest posts from their social media accounts - either Twitter, Instagram or SnapChat. 

As a software engineer specialising in front-end skills, you need to help Zox conceptualise a front-end where one of their social media analyst can choose any of the social media accounts and fetch latest 5 posts along with other details. For a lean version of this screen, client is fine with just Twitter and Instagram posts only.

Zox is obsessed with delivering more than what client asks for. For such a social media tool, you are free to add more features which you feel are easy ones to add which can give any value to the end user.

Feel free to use any front-end framework of your choice. If you think additional documentation which will detail on your thoughts for user experience, feel free to detail it out.

You will judged on elegance of your solution, structure of your application and ease of adding more features to it when application grows.
